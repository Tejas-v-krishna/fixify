# Neo-Restoration Theme & Logistics Flow Update

We have successfully implemented the "Neo-Restoration" theme overhaul and completely restructured the homepage to focus on the logistics and trust value propositions as requested.

## 1. Hero Section ("Pain Point Eliminator")
- **Dynamic Heading**: "Repair without the commute/uncertainty/hidden fees/hassle" using the Typewriter effect.
- **Subheadline**: Emphasizes the "end-to-end platform" and "verified experts".
- **Visuals**: Replaced the abstract phone with a **Logistics Map UI**, featuring an animated rider moving from pickup to the lab, reinforcing the "We come to you" message.
- **CTAs**: Updated to "Schedule a Pickup" (Mint Gradient) and "See how it works".
- **Micro-Copy**: Added "Instant quote • Insured Logistics • Real-time Tracking" for immediate trust.

## 2. New Content Sections
We implemented the following sections in order:
1.  **Why Us**: A split comparison showing "The Local Shop Struggle" vs "The Fixify Experience".
2.  **The Process**: A 4-step visual timeline (Book -> Pickup -> Lab -> Delivery).
3.  **Trust & Safety**: Cards highlighting Data Privacy, Insured Logistics, and 6-Month Warranty.
4.  **Targeting**: specific messaging for Professionals, Students, and Households.
5.  **Service Categories**: A clean grid showing supported devices (Tech, Gaming, Home, Audio).
6.  **Final CTA**: "Ready to repair?" section with a strong call to action.

## 3. Design & Theme
- **Palette**: "Deep Space Violet" (`#0F0E17`) background with "Electric Mint" (`#2DD4BF`) accents and gradients.
- **Styling**: Used glassmorphism (`backdrop-blur`, `bg-white/5`), subtle glows, and Lucide icons for a premium, tech-forward look.

## Verification
- Validated the "Logistics Map" animation in the Hero.
- Confirmed the responsive layout of all new grid sections.
- Verified the correct application of the "Neo-Restoration" color tokens.

The application is now fully aligned with the prompt's content and visual requirements.
